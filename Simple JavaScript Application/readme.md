# Overview #

Write a single page JavaScript application that allows one to search Github.com for repos by keyword.

There is no one way to complete this exercise as long as the minimum requirements are met.

## Requirements ##

1. You can only edit app.js, you cannot touch index.html. jQuery is provided.
2. index.html contains two elements: one for the search term and one for the results.
3. The results should show as a list with each item in an "owner/name" format.
4. When a result is clicked, display an alert with the repo's `language`, `followers`, `url` and `description`.
5. The search term should be cached so duplicate searches do not trigger further requests. 
6. Solution does not need to support older browsers.
